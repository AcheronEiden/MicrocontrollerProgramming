# MicrocontrollerProgramming
This is for saving my project for the course Microcontroller Programming 10hp (Uppsala University course code: 1TE663).
The Program used is VSC together with the PlatformIO extension & the external AVRDUDESS program.

---------------------------------------------------------------

The chosen project is ANIMATION of LCD display (precisely the 1.4 inch SPI 128x128 GREEN TAB LCD display) with different animations based on a button press and INTERRUPTS & TIMERS.

The project isn't done!

---------------------------------------------------------------

 - In the **src folder**, you will find the external libraries & main code used
 - **platformio.ini** is the initiation file where it is stated that the used microcontroller used is an atmega328P, the clock frequency is 1000000UL and where the AVRDUDE is located
